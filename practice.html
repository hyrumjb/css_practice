        <p>I like this, this should be standard usage on my sites.</p>
        <h2 style="background-color:powderblue;">H2: Give me that h2</h2>
        <p>This is smaller and should probably be used for main subheaders.</p>
        <h3>H3: Now h3</h3>
        <p>This one is still useful but is probably the smallest I would go.</p>
        <h4>H4: These are for lower-level headers</h4>
        <p>This one is now basically just bold</p>
        <h5>H5: Gimme that h5</h5>
        <p>This one is now I think smaller than normal paragraph text</p>
        <h6>H6: Last but not least ...</h6>
        <p>This one is now literally a good bit smaller than normal paragraph text.</p>
        <p>Here's the body<br> of my site!</p>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;">The above line is written as one line in my HTML file, but it has a line break in it (which, by the way, is done without a backslash or forward slash).</p>

            Here's a poem about Steve.

            It may be somewhat hard to believe,

            But his life, though short,

            Was of great report.
        </pre>

        <a href="mailto:steve@apple.com">steve@apple.com</a>
        <br>
        <img src="images/steve.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs" height="300" />

        <p style="color:red;">Here's a red paragraph that could contain some other sorts of information</p>
        <p title="Steve Jobs page">Does this actually work if I hover over it?</p>
        <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Here's a big heading, but it's cheating</h1>
        <p>Okay, this is now going to be a <b>paragraph</b> with lots of different <strong>types</strong> of emphasis being used. For example, <i>here</i> is some <em>different</em> types of emphasis and <small>small</small> and <mark>marked</mark> and <del>struck-through</del> and <ins>inserted</ins> and <sub>sub</sub> and <sup>sup</sup> text!</p>
        <h2>More Steve Jobs Info:</h2>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Steve Jobs is truly <q>one of the legends of our generation.</q></p>
