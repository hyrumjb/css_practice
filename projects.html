                <p>this link should work right <a href="steve.html">here</a>. basically, it's a site about steve jobs, with some quotes, video tributes, and his biographer's thoughts on him.
                    also, if i do say so myself, it's some pretty good looking html.

                <p>this one was a project for cs111 at byu. i ended up spending quite a bit of time on it, and when it was 
                    running it was actually running quite beautifully.

                <p>this one was for cs260 at byu, which frankly was a class i wasn't ready for (and actually wasn't really supposed
                    to be in), but i learned a ton from it. i'm not necessarily proud of the aesthetic or even function of this one, but
                    i guess it worked by the end and at least i learned a ton out of necessity.
