                <p>here's a <a href="https://hyrumjb.github.io/st-george/">link</a> to check this project out.
                    once again, this is a project hat used just html and css (less javascript than even the last one), but
                    it seems way more well-designed than the last one. A lot of the features that I emulated in this come from
                    the sequoia capital website, especially the colorway and the fixed header, but there are some mixed ideas as well.

                <p>here's a <a href="https://hyrumjb.github.io/food/">link</a> to check this project out.
                    this is one that used html, css, and started using quite a bit of javascript to analyze the user's choices
                    and provide them with a grade. it uses openai as the engine behind the decision making, grading, and feedback.
                    the design is also built to be responsive to both mobile and varying sizes of desktop interfaces.

                </div>
                <p>this link should work right <a href="steve.html">here</a>. basically, it's a site about steve jobs, with some quotes, video tributes, and his biographer's thoughts on him.
                    also, if i do say so myself, it's some pretty good looking html.

                <p>this one was a project for cs111 at byu. i ended up spending quite a bit of time on it, and when it was 
                    running it was actually running quite beautifully. it lets you add a new block to a blockchain running on render
                    and to provide individualized data for each block. it actually runs quite well, saving the blockchain data, and the
                    ui is basic but aesthetic pa din.

                <p>this one was for cs260 at byu, which frankly was a class i wasn't ready for (and actually wasn't really supposed
                    to be in), but i learned a ton from it. i'm not necessarily proud of the aesthetic or even function of this one, but
                    i guess it worked by the end and at least i learned a ton out of necessity.
